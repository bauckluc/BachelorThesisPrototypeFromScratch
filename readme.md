# Bachelor Thesis

This repository contains the code and resources for my bachelor thesis. The main script, `main.py`, serves as the core of the project and implements the primary functionality.

## Overview of `main.py`

The `main.py` file is responsible for:
- A prototype chatbot to create reference letters based on mock data
- The chatbot can access a vector store, where all employee and job data is stored.

Feel free to explore the code.
